properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The RESETn pin is asserted to disable the sensor causing a hard
      reset. This pin is alias to XSHUTDOWN pin in sensor schematics.
      The sensor receives this as an active-low signal.

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The Power Pin is asserted to enable the 1.2 V and 2.7 V signals needed
      by sensor. The sensor receives this as an active-high signal.

  xsleep-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The XSLEEP Pin is asserted to put the sensor in Low power sleep mode.
      The sensor receives this as an active-low signal.
