properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  dwc-ssi:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable this flag for DWC_ssi only. For SPI devices on apb
      like DW_apb_ssi, disable this flag. Using this flag for the
      combined single driver to differentiate DW-apb-ssi and
      DWC-ssi IPs

  aux-reg:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This value is used for auxiliary register access. For
      other platform, this value should be default 0.

  fifo-depth:
    type: int
    description: |
      RX/TX FIFO depth. Corresponds to the SSI_TX_FIFO_DEPTH
      and SSI_RX_FIFO_DEPTH of the DesignWare Synchronous
      Serial Interface. Depth ranges from 2-256.

  serial-target:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      True if it is a Serial Target. False if it is a Serial
      Master. Corresponds to SSI_IS_MASTER of the Designware
      Synchronous Serial Interface.

  max-xfer-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Maximum transfer size. Corresponds to SPI_MAX_XFER_SIZE
      of the DesignWare Synchronous Serial Interface. Only
      values of 16 and 32 are supported.
    enum:
      - 16
      - 32

  rx-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      The number of SPI_CLK cycles that are delayed before the
      actual sample of the RxD input occurs.

  slv-slct-toggle:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable or Disable the chip select line toggle between
      consecutive data frames.
