	  Enable support for Alif Event Router, a DMA multiplexer that routes
	  peripheral DMA requests to the ARM DMA-PL330 controller.

	  The Event Router provides:
	  - 32 output channels per instance
	  - Each channel can multiplex from 4 peripheral inputs (dma_group)
	  - 1:1 mapping to PL330 peripheral requests
	  - Configurable hardware handshaking per channel

	  This driver acts as a thin wrapper, delegating actual DMA operations
	  to the DMA-PL330 driver while handling event routing configuration.

	  Additionally provides a control API for non-DMA use cases such as
	  UTIMER loopback where events are routed between peripherals without
	  involving DMA transfers.
